# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-

In this project, I participated in a data science competition through Kaggle. The goal of this competition was to predict the probability that individuals will get the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine using a machine learning model. 

I found the gradient boosted machine learning model predicted the probabilites the most accurately out of the models I tried with an accuracy of 85 percent.
